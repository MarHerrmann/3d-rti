3D Radio Tomographic Imaging with Low-Power Wireless Signals

Abstract

Our work utilizes the commonly known 2D Radio
Tomographic Imaging (RTI) technique named “Marauder's
Map” on three distinct layers in order to figure out the possibility
to detect static objects or a moving person on multiple
dimensions in an indoor environment. We studied if this
approach is capable of being used for this intention and if the
information of several layers can be combined to gain reliable
results. Our results show that it is partially possible to combine
this information to detect objects or persons, whereby detecting a
moving person depends on the grids granularity. A fairly small
amount of ten devices is suitable to detect non moving persons on
two of three layers. The observations on the top layer highly
depends on the persons height, whereas the bottom layer is too
inaccurate to detect a non moving person. The middle layer is the
most suitable for this purpose.
